# NoteTaker


## Description

This Note Taker was a great breakdown of what we already learned through front end but now making it work through the backend. Understanding the foundamentals of backend and connecting the routes correctly gave some real world experience on how you should create applications and the steps they should take. 


## Installation

First thing is first we used NPM Install Express, and then we got the packages that come with it. Express is the main installation we went through and used. 

## Usage

This is helpful in alot of ways, I understand that note taking is something that is a early creation for a few developers. But understanding the backend of it really helps. Going through the steps that require it to work perfectly is great. You begind by laying down foundation in the server.js and maping out where you need it to go, server is the main priority, followed by the routes, and inside of that is the API so its amazing.

This was a project that me and a few classmates got together to knockout as a group. But understanding how to communicate is a key essential especially as a developer. 
Again Thank you to the tutoring and all the resources available. The office hours are great and the explination on what we've done this week has been super. Thank you to everyone. Special shoutout to Jaime, he spend a few extra hours with me trying to get things to work.
